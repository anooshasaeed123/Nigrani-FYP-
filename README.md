# Introduction
This application will help to eliminate the usual cliché of information distribution. Visiting
multiple booths at different places can be a hectic job for parents. In this way the parents
can access all the information in a single swipe while sitting at home. Our goal is to assist
parents in such a way that they can keep an eye on their children, their activities and their
academia performance with them being away from home
This application will focus on assisting parents and teachers to bridge the gap between
them by accessing a single/common platform. A whole system is combination of many
parts and this application is no exception, it comprises of student module, teacher module,
parent module and administration. It provide a platform to parents; they can get all details,
information of their children academia performances. They can communicate with teachers
and faculty members. All course details, child performance, grades, will be available at one
single platform.
